The Main advantage of an Array List are the in java already implemented functions such as .get() 
or .add(). 
These need to be added manualy to the Array Class. 
An other advantage of Array List is, that the size of an Array is fixed in the creation and can't
be changed afterwards. For an longer array you need tp create a new one and copy the existing values 
into the new Atray.

Fyi an array can store Objecs and ptimitive Datatypes (like int). An Arraylist can only store 
Objects. If you enter an primitive Value into an Arraylist it will be converted into an Object automaticly
by the Arraylist (int into Integer)
